## Assignment 3

### Understanding

This project involves creating a simple Node.js HTTP server that serves static web pages dynamically using the http, fs, and path modules. The server will handle requests, serve different pages, and provide a basic frontend JavaScript file for DOM manipulation. The navigation will be dynamically injected into all pages to ensure a seamless experience. Additionally, the JavaScript module will be publicly published to npm.

### Features

- Built using Node.js http module.
  Listens on a fallback port (http://localhost:3000).
- Uses fs.readFileSync() and path.join() to dynamically serve files.
  Handles static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

### How to run

```
node server.js
```
